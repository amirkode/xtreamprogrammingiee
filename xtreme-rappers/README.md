Rapper CrissyChris and her friend, JaCe, will participate in Gold Level, one of the most important events of freestyle in the world. They are training improvising 3-word phrases, where each one has to contribute at least one word.

They want to improvise the maximum number of phrases without repeating words (a word can be used only in one phrase), CrissyChris and JaCe select an assortment of words from Ctoke’s database (Ctoke is one of the oldest rappers in freestyle and his database contains only unique words). CrissyChris and JaCe both selects [K] and [J] words from the database respectively. CrissyChris and JaCe never have words in common.

CrissyChris is an actual legend within IEEE and has supported the IEEEXtreme competition for the past 13 years in one way or another; whether it was all those late nights throughout the competitions or purchasing and shipping all of the top 100 prizes! She has recently moved on within IEEE to another department. This challenge is a tribute to her and all she has done to enrich the competition through the years! Farewell Christine Eldridge, you will be missed!
