You are given an array AAA of size NNN and a set SSS with MMM elements. Each number from 111 to N+MN + MN+M occurs exactly once in either AAA or SSS.

You need to insert the elements from the set SSS into the array AAA in order to obtain the lexicographically smallest permutation.

Note: A Sequence X1..nX_{1..n}X​1..n​​, of the same length as a sequence Y1..nY_{1..n}Y​1..n​​, is considered lexicographically smaller than Y1..nY_{1..n}Y​1..n​​ if, and only if, there exists an index jjj for which XiX_{i}X​i​​ = YiY_{i}Y​i​​ for 1≤i<j1 \le i \lt j1≤i<j, and Xj<YjX_{j} \lt Y_{j}X​j​​<Y​j​​.
